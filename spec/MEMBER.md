# Member

A [Member](#member) is an identity consisting of an general display name,
a [Login](LOGIN.md) and a [Role](ROLE.md), which describes the
permissions they have in their [Team](TEAM.md). Members must be assigned
to only one [Team](TEAM.md); If the [Team](TEAM.md) gets deleted, the [Member](#member) does too.
